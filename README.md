# Power-BI-Revenue_Insights_in_Hospitality_Domain

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for hotels in the hospitality industry. I developed 26 detailed metrics to track various aspects of hotel performance, including revenue, bookings, occupancy, and customer behavior. The dashboard provides an interactive and dynamic view of these metrics, helping hotel managers and stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.

**Key Metrics Created:**

•	Revenue: Total revenue realized across all bookings.

•	Total Bookings: Total number of bookings made.

•	Total Capacity: Total room capacity across all hotels.

•	Total Successful Bookings: Number of successful bookings (confirmed stays).

•	Occupancy %: Percentage of rooms occupied, calculated as successful bookings to total room capacity.

•	Average Rating: Average customer ratings for the hotel.

•	Total Cancellations & Cancellation %: Total number of canceled bookings and the cancellation percentage.

•	Total Checked-Out & No Show Bookings: Number of successful check-outs and no-show bookings (customers who neither canceled nor attended).

•	Booking % by Platform: Distribution of bookings across various platforms (e.g., MakeYourTrip, LogTrip).

•	Booking % by Room Class: Distribution of bookings across room classes like Standard, Elite, Premium, and Presidential.

•	ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average revenue per room sold.

•	Realization %: Percentage of successful check-outs against total bookings.

•	RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Measures revenue generated per available room, regardless of occupancy.

•	DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Average rooms booked per day over a given time period.

•	DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Average rooms available for sale per day.

•	DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Average rooms utilized by customers per day.

•	Weekly Changes: Metrics to track week-over-week changes for Revenue, Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, Realization, and DSRN.

**Dashboard Features:**

•	Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes interactive charts, graphs, and slicers to enable users to explore trends across different metrics.

•	Time-Series Analysis: Provides insights into how metrics such as revenue, occupancy, and ADR change over time, with comparisons between weeks and months.

•	Booking and Revenue Insights: Visualize booking performance by room class, booking platform, and other key parameters, helping to identify top-performing areas.

•	Comparative Analysis: Track and compare weekly, monthly, and yearly trends for important metrics like cancellation rates, no-show bookings, and revenue realization.

•	Actionable Insights: The dashboard helps to identify areas for operational improvement, such as reducing cancellations, improving occupancy, or optimizing room pricing.

By using this Power BI dashboard, hotel managers can gain a real-time, comprehensive view of their operations, allowing them to optimize revenue, occupancy, and customer satisfaction. This project empowers data-driven decision-making, improving overall hotel performance.
